        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am studying business administration at the University of California Riverside as a student in my second year. Iâ€™m a California native and 2nd generation American, and many of my family members have owned businesses before me as a way to earn money when they first immigrated here. My grandmother owned a textile factory, and my grandmother designs clothing. My uncle was an artist in New York who sold abstract art for millions of dollars in the high-art scene. Needless to say, they're a great inspiration to me and always have been. I have always had a great interest in business and a drive to succeed at what I do. I love the challenge that comes with owning and maintaining a business and I can see myself happily doing so.
          <br><br>

        Although I have never owned a business myself, I'm grateful to have been given many opportunities to work alongside business owners through different jobs I've performed. Through these experiences, I've been able to observe different business environments and learned hands on what it was like to be in various industries. For example, I worked at Hobby Lobby for 2 years as a teen. Although I was only a sales associate, I still benefited from conversations with my higher-ups about what it was like to manage a store of that size. I also believe I greatly benefited from the one-on-one interaction with customers,as I got to hear first hand what they wanted and was the one to deal with their concerns. I also learned how to sell them on a product, and realized what a large role propper customer service played in the success of a business.        

        <br><br>

        Throughout my life, Iâ€™ve always been very business-minded. As a child, I would sell different items Iâ€™d crafted to my classmates, such as stickers and keychains. Even now as an adult, I enjoy doing commision work online, gaining first hand experience in marketing and negotiation of my services. Although Iâ€™m not a proper business owner, I do consider myself experienced in doing business myself, as I still had to tap into key skills and develop my abilities to make money through the different products and services I had offered. As I get older, more opportunities arise and I find myself interested in expanding my pseudo business. I have many goals, such as setting up an online shop for my products and appearing at different events to sell in-person at a table or a booth. I consider myself motivated and I'm confident that I can achieve anything i truely out my mind to do, so business has always appealed to me. Iâ€™ve recently taken up a mentorship under the vice president of investment at UCR, and I am aiming for a job at the bank. Every day I learn something new about business and economy, and all of it fascinates me. Things are only getting better and more intriguing. As a student, Iâ€™m excited and eager to learn about every aspect of business at UCR.
